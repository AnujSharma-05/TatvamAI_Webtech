# TatvamAI Webtech

TatvamAI is a multilingual voice-data crowdsourcing platform built to collect, validate, evaluate, and reward user-recorded speech contributions.

This repository contains two major applications:

- `backend/` - an Express + MongoDB API that handles authentication, user onboarding, recording ingestion, reward-token issuance, OTP verification, and admin workflows.
- `frontend/` - a Vite + React application that provides the public site, authentication flows, contributor dashboard, QR-based recording experience, profile management, and admin dashboard.

The system is designed around a simple principle:

1. A contributor signs up or signs in.
2. The user records speech for a selected language and domain.
3. The audio is uploaded to AWS S3.
4. An external Python analysis service evaluates the recording.
5. The backend converts the evaluation into a quality label and reward token amount.
6. The contributor sees the result in their dashboard.

The code in this repository implements the web platform and backend orchestration. The audio-scoring service is invoked through `PYTHON_SERVER_URL` and is not part of this workspace.

## What This Product Does

TatvamAI is built for dataset creation and contributor management in a voice-tech pipeline. It supports:

- user registration with email and phone verification

## System Architecture

The architecture is a classic split between a browser client, a Node.js API, cloud storage, and an external evaluation service.

### Design Principles

- The frontend never talks directly to MongoDB or S3.
- The backend owns identity, authorization, and data lifecycle decisions.
- Raw audio is treated as a binary asset and stored outside the database.
- The recording record in MongoDB is the source of truth for metadata.
- Evaluation is decoupled from upload so upload and scoring can evolve independently.

## End-to-End User Pipeline

### 1. Registration and Verification

The contributor signup flow is intentionally strict because the platform depends on clean contributor identity.

Frontend steps:

1. User opens the signup page.
2. User enters name, gender, date of birth, city, mother tongue, known languages, email, phone number, and password.
3. The frontend checks:
	 - password confirmation
	 - minimum password length
	 - phone number format
	 - age of at least 18
	 - whether the email or phone already exists
4. The user requests phone OTP verification.
5. The user requests email verification code.
6. The user enters both codes.
7. The user submits the registration form.

Backend behavior:

- `/api/v1/users/check-user-existence` verifies whether the email or phone already belongs to an account.
- `/api/v1/users/send-phone-otp-register` creates a temporary OTP record and sends the code through SMS.
- `/api/v1/users/verify-phone-otp` confirms the phone number.
- `/api/v1/users/send-verification-code` creates a temporary email code and sends it through Gmail SMTP.
- `/api/v1/users/verify-email-code` confirms the email address.
- `/api/v1/users/register` creates the account, hashes the password, marks both verification flags, and returns access and refresh tokens.

### 2. Authentication

The platform supports two login modes:

- Email + password
- Phone OTP login

On successful login, the backend issues:

- access token for API authorization
- refresh token for session renewal

The frontend stores both tokens in `localStorage` and sends the access token on each request through the Axios interceptor.

### 3. Contribution and Recording Flow

The contribution experience is the main product loop.

Frontend steps:

1. The contributor opens the QR or recording flow.
2. The system may generate a paragraph based on selected language and domain.
3. The contributor records the prompt in the browser using microphone access.
4. The recording can be paused, resumed, stopped, and reviewed.
5. The user submits the audio file together with metadata such as language, dialect, domain, duration, and recording source.

Backend steps:

- The file is received through Multer as an in-memory upload.
- The binary audio is sent to AWS S3.
- A `Recording` document is created in MongoDB with the S3 URL and metadata.
- Later, the recording is evaluated and a `RewardToken` document is created.

### 4. Evaluation and Rewarding

When a recording is evaluated, the backend:

1. Loads the recording from MongoDB.
2. Resolves the S3 key from the stored recording URL.
3. Sends the S3 key to the external Python analysis service.
4. Receives the overall quality score.
5. Converts the score into one of the platform quality labels:
	 - excellent
	 - good
	 - average
	 - below_average
	 - poor
6. Assigns a reward amount using a randomized reward band.
7. Stores the quality on the recording document.
8. Creates a reward token record.
9. Increments the user reward balance.

This means the recording and reward documents are linked, and the dashboard can always reconstruct the contributor history from the database.

## Backend Architecture

### Server Bootstrap

- `backend/src/index.js` loads environment variables, connects to MongoDB, and starts the Express app.
- `backend/src/app.js` defines middleware, CORS behavior, route mounting, and the test endpoint.

### Route Groups

#### Health Check

- `GET /api/v1/healthcheck`

#### Users

- `POST /api/v1/users/register`
- `POST /api/v1/users/login`
- `POST /api/v1/users/logout`
- `POST /api/v1/users/refresh-token`
- `GET /api/v1/users/current`
- `GET /api/v1/users/recordings`
- `POST /api/v1/users/change-password`

- `GET /api/v1/reward-tokens/admin`
- `GET /api/v1/reward-tokens/stats`
- `GET /api/v1/reward-tokens/api/tokens/recording/:id`

### Authentication Model

Authentication is JWT-based.

- `verifyJWT` reads the token from the `Authorization` header or cookies.
- `authorizeRoles` restricts admin routes.
- Access tokens are short-lived.
- Refresh tokens are persisted in the user document.
- The frontend stores tokens in `localStorage` and updates UI state through custom events.

### Data Storage Model

#### User

Core fields:

- name
- email
- phoneNo
- password
- role
- gender
- dob
- city
- motherTongue
- knownLanguages
- refreshToken
- recordings
- rewardTokens
- emailVerified
- phoneNoVerified

#### Recording

Core fields:

- userId
- recordingUrl
- language
- dialect
- domain
- duration
- recordedVia
- quality
- transcription

#### RewardToken

Core fields:

- userId
- recordingId
- final_quality
- amount
- reason
- status
- method

#### Verification

Used for temporary OTP and email verification codes.

### Important Backend Behaviors

- Audio uploads are stored in S3 under the `raw-audio/` prefix.
- The platform currently uses Renflair for SMS OTP delivery, even though an older utility also references 2Factor.
- Email verification uses Gmail SMTP through Nodemailer.
- Paragraph generation uses the Gemini API.
- The evaluation step expects a Python service at `PYTHON_SERVER_URL` with an `/analyze` endpoint.

## Frontend Architecture

### Routing

The frontend uses React Router to separate public and protected experiences.

Public routes include:

- `/`
- `/products`
- `/dhvani-shilp`
- `/about`
- `/contact`
- `/blogs`
- `/demo`
- `/faq`
- `/docs`
- `/careers`
- `/about-tatvam`
- `/auth/signin`
- `/auth/signup`

Protected routes include:

- `/dashboard`
- `/admin`
- `/qr`
- `/qr-recording`
- `/profile`

### Frontend State and Session Handling

- `frontend/src/config/axios.ts` injects the access token into the `Authorization` header.
- A 401 response clears tokens and redirects the user to sign in.
- `frontend/src/utils/auth.ts` provides helpers to set, clear, and inspect tokens.
- `AuthContext` rehydrates the user from `/users/current` when a token exists.

## Environment Variables

### Backend

Create a `backend/.env` file with the following values:

```env
PORT=8000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster>
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_access_secret
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY=1d
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=your_refresh_secret
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY=10d
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret
AWS_REGION=ap-south-1
AWS_S3_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
EMAIL_USER=your_gmail_address
EMAIL_PASS=your_gmail_app_password
RENFLAIR_API_KEY=your_sms_api_key
TWOFACTOR_API_KEY=legacy_optional_key
ADMIN_SECRET=your_admin_bootstrap_secret
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
PYTHON_SERVER_URL=https://your-python-service.example.com
```

Notes:

- `TWOFACTOR_API_KEY` appears in an older utility, but the current OTP code path uses Renflair.
- `PYTHON_SERVER_URL` must point to the external analyzer service that exposes `/analyze`.
- `ADMIN_SECRET` is used by the temporary admin bootstrap route.

### Frontend

The frontend currently points Axios at:

- production: `https://tatvamai-webtech.onrender.com`
- local fallback: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1`

If you move environments, update `frontend/src/config/axios.ts` accordingly.

## Local Development Setup

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Runtime Notes

- The backend serves static files from `backend/public`.
- Auth is token-based rather than cookie-based in the frontend state layer.
- The app uses CORS allowlisting for production and local development origins.
- Recording uploads rely on the browser granting microphone permission.
- QR scanning relies on webcam permission.
- Admin routes require both a valid JWT and the `admin` role.

## Known Implementation Details

- The backend codebase is organized for a serverless-friendly split, but this repository itself only contains the API and browser applications, not the external Python analyzer implementation.
- The reward algorithm is intentionally probabilistic inside score bands. That means two recordings with the same quality score can receive different token amounts.
- The frontend currently uses `localStorage` for tokens, so a 401 response forces re-authentication.
- The repository contains a legacy `structure.txt` that still references Cloudinary and older filenames. The actual implementation in this workspace uses AWS S3 and the current `src/` structure.

## Suggested Next Steps

1. Add API request and response examples for every route.
2. Add a deployment section for the backend, frontend, and Python analyzer separately.
3. Add screenshots or GIFs for signup, recording, dashboard, and admin workflows.
4. Add an architecture decision log if you want this README to evolve with the product.
